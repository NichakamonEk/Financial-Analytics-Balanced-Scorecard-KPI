## Project Overview
This project evaluates the business performance of **Jubilee Superstores** through two integrated components:

1. **Financial performance analysis** using interactive dashboards  
2. **Strategic Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and KPI development** aligned with long-term business and ESG objectives  

The project goes beyond reporting by translating financial and non-financial insights into a **structured performance management framework** that supports sustainable value creation.

## Business Context
Jubilee Superstores is a multi-category retailer operating across products, regions, and customer segments.  
Management requires visibility not only into profitability, but also into the **drivers of performance, sustainability risks, and ethical responsibilities**.

Key challenges identified include:
- Strong operational efficiency but weak gross margin performance  
- Variations in profitability across regions, divisions, and channels  
- Increasing expectations around ESG, reconciliation, and ethical data governance

## Financial Performance Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to assess performance across multiple dimensions:

▪️ Executive KPI overview covering revenue, gross profit, and operating margin  
▪️ Margin analysis (GPM vs OPM) against strategic targets  
▪️ Dimensional analysis by region, city, division, customer segment, and channel  
▪️ Drill-down capability from category to product level  
▪️ Geographic analysis highlighting high-performing cities and regions  

Key findings include:
- Operating margin exceeded target (30.1% vs 16%), indicating strong operational control  
- Gross margin remained below target (18.8% vs 40%), suggesting pricing and supplier cost pressure  
- Technology and Home Office segments were major profitability drivers  
- Eastern coastal cities such as Gold Coast and Hobart emerged as profit centres

## Balanced Scorecard Design
To extend performance evaluation beyond finance, a **customised Balanced Scorecard** was developed.

Instead of the traditional four perspectives, the framework was expanded to **six perspectives** to reflect Jubilee’s strategic shift toward sustainability and ethical accountability:

- Financial  
- Customer  
- Internal Process  
- Learning & Growth  
- Social Performance  
- Environmental Sustainability  
- Indigenous Data Sovereignty & Ethics  

This structure enables a holistic view of performance, linking financial outcomes with social impact, environmental responsibility, and ethical data governance

## KPI Development & Strategic Logic
Twelve KPIs were designed using a **cause-and-effect logic**, where:

▪️ Employee capability and engagement enable operational efficiency  
▪️ Efficient processes improve customer satisfaction and trust  
▪️ Customer trust supports social and environmental investment  
▪️ Ethical governance sustains long-term stakeholder confidence  

KPIs were defined with clear:
- Business relevance  
- Measurement logic  
- Data sources  
- Strategic targets  

The framework explicitly incorporates **ESG and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles**, including FPIC compliance and CARE principles, translating ethical commitments into measurable accountability
